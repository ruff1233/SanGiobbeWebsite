                This small piece of symbolism is yet another allusion to the iconography of Venice. The city was often associated with the sea through various symbols and mediums, such
                as the portrayal of Poseidon in the de' Barbari Map on and the Marriage of the Sea ceremony. Bellini ties his artwork to the city it was created in through the portrayal
                of sea creatures on the top of each column, supporting the roof of the great church.
