                <h1>The Golden Dome</h1>
                The dome that sits at the top of the painting is a clear allusion to the chapel of San Marco, one of the most iconic buildings in all of Venice. Venice aligned
                itself with Saint Mark, and many of the early artworks of the Renaissance in Venice included lots of symbols and references to the iconography of Venice - the dome
                portrayed at the top of this altarpiece being one of them. However, creating a painting with a dome that makes the painting looks like a section of a church was not
                introduced to Venetian art until the creation of this painting [1]. 
                <br></br>
                The main aspect of the dome that makes it clear this is meant to refer to San Marco is its elaborate gold decoration. Much of the interior of the San Marco has a similarly
                exquisite theme of gold and other vibrant coloration. This style was likely taken from Byzantine places of worship, such as the Hagia Sophia.
