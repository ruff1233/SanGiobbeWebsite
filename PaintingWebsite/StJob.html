                <h1>Saint Job</h1>
                Saint Job's representation in this image is of vital importance, as he was the patron saint of the San Giobbe church. His depiction in this image serves much of the same
                purpose as Saint Sebastian's. Saint Job is Saint Sebastian's counterpart in this image, two elegant mostly-nudes on either side of the Madonna and Child. Despite being
                shown as an old man, Job's body is still athletic and spry, hardly contrasting with the young body of Saint Sebastian. In this painting, Bellini chose not to depict
                the brutal sores Job was said to have on his skin in the Bible. Job has thus been resurrected, as he claims he will be in the Bible, free from mortal physical pain
                and finally in the presence of God [1].
