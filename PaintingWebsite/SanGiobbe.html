                <h1>About the San Giobbe Altarpiece:</h1>
                This artwork was painted by Giovanni Bellini in 1480 through the medium of oil paint on panel. The work was originally displayed in the church of San Giobbe,
                but has since been moved to the Gallerie dell'Acamdemia, Venice. This is one of Bellini's first uses of oil painting, as he began to a gradual shift away from the use of egg tempera.
                This new type of painting gave his artwork a more naturalistic look, with the ability to display light and shadows in a far more detailed way than he was able to before [2].
