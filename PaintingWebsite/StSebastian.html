                <h1>Saint Sebastian</h1>
                Located to the right of the Madonna and Child, Saint Sebastian stands casually, arrow wounds clearly visible. The pose he takes is called a contropposto stance, where
                leans to one side with most of his weight on one leg. This pose contrasts to earlier Renaissance works, where many human figures are posed statically with weight
                evenly distributed on one foot. This contrapposto stance gives Saint Sebastian a much more lifelike and relatable portrayal [2]. Saint Sebastian's divinity and spirituality
                and exemplified through the contrapposto pose as well. Despite being grievously wounded from arrows, with blood seeping from the wound on his stomach, he displays no pain
                or discomfort whatsoever - showing how he has been "released from any hint of physical suffering" [2].
