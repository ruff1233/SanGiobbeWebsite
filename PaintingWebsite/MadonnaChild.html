                <h1>The Madonna and Child</h1>
                The central figures in the image - and arguably the most important - are the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus Christ, sitting atop a throne, with several saints flanking them
                on either side. Like so many other aspects of this painting, the portrayal of the Virgin Mary is a reference to the city of Venice itself. For its entire history, Venice has
                aligned itself with the values instrinsic to the Virgin Mary - purity and duty.
                <br></br>
                What makes this this portrayal of the Madonna and Child unique is the impersonal expressions and gestures they make. The Madonna may be turning towards worshippers
                to acknowledge them, but her facial experession is clearly uninterested and unfocused. Jesus, despite facing towards the viewer, does not look ahead. Instead, the child looks
                upward, with his hands not in the typical blessing gesture. [1]
